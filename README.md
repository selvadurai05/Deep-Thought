# DT Web Development Assignment – Task 1  
Frontend Webpage (HTML + CSS) Based on Figma Design

This repository contains my submission for **DeepThought’s Web Development Assignment – Task 1**.  
The goal of this task was to recreate the given **Figma UI screen** using **only HTML and CSS**, without any JavaScript.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The UI is based on the **Expanded Journey Board screen** from the Figma design.  
The page includes:

- ✔ Top navigation bar  
- ✔ Main journey board container  
- ✔ Overview card  
- ✔ Video placeholder card  
- ✔ Thread input card  
- ✔ Structure your pointers card  
- ✔ 4SA Method card  
- ✔ Exact color styling inspired from the Figma design  
- ✔ Responsive simplified layout  

Task-1 focuses only on **static design**, so all content is implemented using:

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3 (no frameworks)**  
- **Placeholder text** (as required)
- **Exact color theme** from the Figma screen
